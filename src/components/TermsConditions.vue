        <h2>MEDICAL DISCLAIMER</h2>
        <p>We are not a health care or medical device provider, nor should our Products be considered medical advice. Only your physician or other health care provider can do that.

        <p>Any health information and links on the Products, whether provided by Dark Femme or by contract from outside providers, is provided simply for your convenience.</p>

They are not intended to be relied upon and are not a substitute for professional medical advice based on your individual condition and circumstances. The advice and other materials we make available are intended to support the relationship between you and your healthcare providers and not replace it. We are not liable or responsible for any consequences of your having read or been told about such advice or other materials as you assume full responsibility for your decisions and actions. In particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we make no representation or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or suitability for any purpose of the advice, other materials, and information published as part of the Products.</p>
        <p>There have been rare reports where people with certain psychiatric problems like anxiety and depression have experienced worsening conditions in conjunction with intensive listening practice. People with existing mental health conditions should speak with their health care providers before starting a meditation practice.</p>
